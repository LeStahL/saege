Track -> Piano roll editor (Matrix with notes)
Sequence -> Sequence editor (Matrix with tracks)
Module -> Module editor (Matrix with sequences)

-> we need a matrix editor

data in matrix?
-> piano roll: note is on/off {0,1}
-> sequence editor: instrument is playing/silent {0,1}
-> module editor: sequence is active/inactive {0,1}

need a matrix stack

instrument -> instrument editor? have to discuss
